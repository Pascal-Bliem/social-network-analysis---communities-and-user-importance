# Social Network Analysis - Communities and User Importance

## Introduction
In this project, I was interested in learning about structures within social networks. Among millions of users, can we identify communities? Can we find out which users have a special role or are especially important within these communities? Follow along and we will try to assess how important users are in a network of over 80000 Twitter users, based on their in-degree centrality and Page-Rank score. In the second part, we will try to identify communities within the Facebook data of 783 UC San Diego students, using the Girvan-Newmann algorithm.

Of cource I'm not the first person asking these questions and there great libraries already out there, but since I worked on this project as part of an open-ended capstone of the MOOC specialization *Object Oriented Java Programming: Data Structures and Beyond* on [Coursera.org](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-object-oriented), I coded up the algorithms from scratch in Java and used NetworkX in Python to test my code.
